# Skypatches
This is a collection of my various skypatches to make various modifications to the game. Some will be more useful than others; I just put everything I write here, including requests. I do my best to document what they do, so make sure you know what you're applying!

If you're just looking to use these patches, you'll want to go into the folder for the patch you want and download the .skypatch file itself! Everything else in the folders is the actual code powering the patches.

## What about PMD: Crowned?
If you're looking for my patches made for and used exclusively in my ROMhack, PMD: Crowned- they're not here, sorry! Crowned uses [c-of-time](https://github.com/SkyTemple/c-of-time), which isn't skypatches. if you *really* want to use code from that, just ask- I can adapt it into a skypatch if doing so is feasible, and if not I can at the very least give you the C code.
