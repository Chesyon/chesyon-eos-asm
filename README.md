# chesyon-eos-asm
Hello intrepid readers/hackers! This repository stores all of my custom ASM code for Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky, for use in SkyTemple. If you aren't a SkyTemple user, this repo probably won't be of much help to you, but welcome regardless!
Everything is categorized into a few separate categories:
* **Skypatches**, patches that overwrite/add to the game's original code to change the way it functions.
* **Special Processes** (or **SPs**), blocks of ASM code that can be called from cutscene scripts to do all sorts of things.
* ~~**Move Effects**, blocks of ASM code that can be used to control the way a move works.~~
* ~~**Item Effects**, blocks of ASM code that can be used to control the way an item works.~~

All code in this repository is free to use and modify with credit to me alongside any additional authors listed for code you use.
I write lots of comments in my code, and there's a template to write your own skypatches, so I hope that this repository can also serve as a helpful resource for people who want to learn ASM.
